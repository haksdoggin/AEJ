                <h1> Tokyo Ghoul </h1>
                <p> The ghouls who manage the coffee shop. Set in a world where humans live in constant fear of ghouls - superpowered humanoid beings who feed on human flesh to survive, a shy college student named Kaneki Ken, who is nearly killed in an attack by one of these monsters, becomes a half-ghoul himself after receiving an organ transplant from the ghoul. Realizing what has become of him, Kaneki is forced to adapt to his new lifestyle whilst avoiding two relentless police officers who want to exterminate all ghouls from their ward.</p>
